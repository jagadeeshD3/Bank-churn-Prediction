# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## üìñ Overview

This project is a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting customer churn in a banking environment. The primary goal is to identify customers who are likely to close their accounts (churn). By accurately predicting churn, the bank can proactively implement retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and maintain its revenue base.

The project covers all key stages of the machine learning pipeline, including:

  * **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features.
  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover insights and relationships.
  * **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables and addressing class imbalance using oversampling.
  * **Model Training and Evaluation:** Building and evaluating multiple classification models to find the best performer.
  * **Feature Importance:** Identifying the key drivers of customer churn.
  * **Model Validation:** Using cross-validation to ensure the model's stability and reliability.

## üíæ Dataset

The project uses the **"Churn\_Modelling.csv"** dataset, which contains details of bank customers who have either left the bank (churned) or continue to be a customer.

**Key features include:**

  * `CreditScore`: The customer's credit score.
  * `Geography`: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain, Germany).
  * `Gender`: The customer's gender.
  * `Age`: The customer's age.
  * `Tenure`: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
  * `Balance`: The customer's account balance.
  * `NumOfProducts`: The number of products the customer has with the bank.
  * `HasCrCard`: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
  * `IsActiveMember`: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
  * `EstimatedSalary`: The estimated salary of the customer.
  * `Exited`: The target variable, indicating whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## üöÄ Project Workflow

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Cleaning:**

      * Dropped irrelevant columns (`RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`).
      * Checked for and removed any duplicate entries.
      * Handled missing values using appropriate strategies (mode, median, ffill).

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

      * Analyzed the distribution of the target variable `Exited`, revealing a significant class imbalance (**\~80% Stayed, \~20% Churned**).
      * Visualized the distributions of numerical features using histograms and boxplots.
      * Examined the distributions of categorical features (`Geography`, `Gender`) using count plots and pie charts.
      * Investigated the relationships between various features and the churn outcome.

3.  **Data Preprocessing:**

      * **Categorical Encoding:** Applied one-hot encoding to the `Geography` column and binary encoding to the `Gender` column.
      * **Handling Class Imbalance:** Utilized **Random Oversampling** to balance the dataset, creating an equal number of samples for both churned and non-churned classes. This prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class.
      * **Feature Scaling:** Standardized the numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

4.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**

      * Split the balanced dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
      * Trained five different classification models:
          * Logistic Regression
          * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
          * Decision Tree
          * Random Forest
          * XGBoost
      * Evaluated each model based on **Accuracy**, and generated a detailed `classification_report` (with Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and a `confusion_matrix`.

## üìä Key Insights from EDA

  * **Geography:** Customers from **Germany** have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those from France and Spain.
  * **Age:** The churn rate is higher for middle-aged customers, particularly in the **40-50 age group**.
  * **Gender:** **Female** customers have a slightly higher tendency to churn than male customers.
  * **Number of Products:** Customers with **3 or 4 products** have a very high churn rate, suggesting dissatisfaction or complexity. Customers with 2 products are the most stable.
  * **Balance:** Customers with a **high account balance** are more likely to churn, which is a counter-intuitive but critical insight.

## üèÜ Model Performance Summary

After training and evaluation, the models performed as follows. The **Random Forest Classifier** emerged as the best-performing model.

| Model                 | Accuracy |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| **Random Forest** | **0.9416** |
| XG Boost              | 0.9234   |
| Decision Tree         | 0.8936   |
| SVM                   | 0.7937   |
| Logistic Regression   | 0.7709   |

A 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the Random Forest model, which yielded a **mean accuracy of 0.9976** on the training data, confirming its robustness and low variance.

## üîë Feature Importance

The feature importance analysis from the best model (Random Forest) revealed the most influential factors in predicting customer churn:

1.  **Age:** The most significant predictor.
2.  **EstimatedSalary:** High importance, indicating salary plays a key role.
3.  **CreditScore:** A strong indicator of customer behavior.
4.  **Balance:** A customer's account balance is a crucial factor.
5.  **NumOfProducts:** The number of products a customer uses is also highly predictive.
