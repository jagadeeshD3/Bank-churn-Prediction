# Bank-churn-Prediction
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting customer churn in a banking environment. The primary goal is to identify customers who are likely to close their accounts (churn). By accurately predicting churn, the bank can implement retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and maintain its revenue base.
